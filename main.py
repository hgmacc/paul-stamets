ML A1

-- Question 2 --
Describe the dataset you have collected:
    - total number of samples,
    - total number of measurements,
    - brief description of the measurements included,
    - nature of the group of interest and what differentiates it from the other samples,
    - sample counts for your group of interest and sample count for the group not of interest.

• Write a program that analyzes each measurement individually.
• For each measurement, compute the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).
• Provide a printout of the 10 leading measurements (highest AUC), making it clear what those measurements
    represent in your dataset (these are the measurements with the most obvious potential to inform prediction in any given machine
    learning algorithm).
• Provide a printout of this code.
